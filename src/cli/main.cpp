  librevault restart [--daemon=<daemon>]
  librevault version [--daemon=<daemon>]
  librevault globals list [--daemon=<daemon>]
  librevault globals get [--daemon=<daemon>] <key>
  librevault globals set [--daemon=<daemon>] <key> <value>
  librevault globals unset [--daemon=<daemon>] <key>
  librevault folder add [--daemon=<daemon>] <secret> <path> [(-o <key> <value>)]...
  librevault folder remove [--daemon=<daemon>] <folderid>
  librevault folder reindex [--daemon=<daemon>] <folderid>
  librevault folder list-folders [--daemon=<daemon>]
